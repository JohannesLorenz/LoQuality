Thanks for deciding for LoQuality as a music player. Our intend is to let
you gather as much music on your local hard disc as you like.

It is still in a "pre-alpha" phase, so please do not expect too much!
Documentation of the player will be added soon.

Installation: Compile LoQuality in 3 steps!

1. Read and accept license
2. ./configure
3. make

That's it. Enjoy!
