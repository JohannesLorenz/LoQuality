This list contains tasks that need to be done in the future.
If you want one of them, contact me!

* writing parameter code, especially --help and --version
* multi-threading the code which fills in the main window table
* closing LQ should keep it running in the background - via tray icon
* tray Icons needs things like forward, backward, play, pause
* we need a directory ./doc which lets doxygen be built via a Makefile
* a graphical options dialog (automatic or pre-coded??)
* set up wiki on github (mostly to give help about LQs features)
* spaces or apostrophes in filenames do not seem to be recognized sometimes
* a button next to the artist's pixmap which let's you download pngs
* extend the dbus code (write all functions)
* write a "radio alarm clock" (simple: append a menu to play, which
   will come up with a date selection)
* get some nice new icons for some buttons/menu items
* Translation code (how is that done??) and than translation files

PLANS FOR MUSIC SHARING:

0.) A sends song DB to B
1.) B * opens song db (with lq)
      * sees a comparison of tracks (created with a join op)
      * chooses tracks (with lq)
2.) B sends request (= textfile which only contains A's filepaths) to A
3.) A somehow converts that into an SSH command and sends it to B
