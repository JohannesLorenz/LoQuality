This list contains tasks that need to be done in the future.
If you want one of them, contact me!

* Writing parameter code, especially --help and --version
* Multi-Threading the code which fills in the main window table
* Closing LQ should keep it running in the background - via tray icon
* Tray Icons needs things like forward, backward, play, pause
* something like ~/.LoQuality would be great...
* we need a directory ./doc which lets doxygen be built via a Makefile
* a graphical options dialog (automatic or pre-coded??)
* set up wiki on github (mostly to give help about LQs features)
* spaces or apostrophes in filenames do not seem to be recognized sometimes
* a button next to the artist's pixmap which let's you download pngs
